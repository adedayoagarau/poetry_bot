intact
abandoned
its nouns, the idea
itself fell
apart and was
last seen somewhere
in an enamel
bowl in pieces
next to a bone saw)
We came upon her at dusk
in a dense forest
of monitors
draped cuffs, dangling
salines, tapes, drains
broad bandages, electrodes
We tried not to be terrified
and failed
We looked to her as we always had
We tried to tell her she looked fine
Because she could not see herself
she tried to put us at ease
We asked her how she felt, really
She was very calm (the meds)
"I was worried," she said
"but nothing has changed. Listen,
beyond the windows:
the creak of bullock carts
breaking waves, crows,
the call to prayer."''',
